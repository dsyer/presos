== Outline
* What are microservices?
* Some distributed system problems
* Introduce Spring Cloud
* Spring Cloud demos

== What are microservices?
* Not monolithic :-)
* Smaller units of a larger system
* Runs in its own process
* Lightweight communication protocols
* Single Responsibility Principle
* The UNIX way

== No Man (Microservice) is an Island

> It's excellent to be able to implement a microservice really easily

There are laws of physics that make some problems unsolvable
(consistency, latency), but brittleness and manageability can be
addressed with *generic*, *boiler plate* patterns.

== Emergent features of micro-services systems

Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns

* Distributed/versioned configuration
* Service registration and discovery
* Service-to-service calls
* Load balancing
* Routing
* Tracing
* Circuit Breaker
* Asynchronous patterns
* Distributed messaging

== Spring IO Platform

== Example: Spring Cloud and Netflix

== Configuration Server
* Pluggable source
* Git implementation
* Versioned
* Rollback-able
* Configuration client auto-configured via starter

Alternatives: Zookeeper, Consul

== Discovery: Eureka
* Service Registration Server
* Highly Available
* In AWS terms, multi Availability Zone and Region aware
* Can be used as "sidecar" via `@EnableSidecar`

== Circuit Breaker: Hystrix
* latency and fault tolerance
* isolates access to other services
* stops cascading failures
* dashboard

Release It!: https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it[https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it]

== Hystrix Observable

[source,java]
----
@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod="getDefaultMessage")
public String getMessage() {
  return restTemplate.getForObject(/*...*/);
}

public String getDefaultMessage() {
  return "Hello World Default";
}

// somewhere else
helloService.getMessage();
----

== Routing: Zuul
* JVM based router and filter
* Similar routing role as httpd, nginx, or CF go router
* Fully programmable rules and filters
* Groovy
* Java
* Any JVM language

== Spring Cloud Zuul Proxy

* Store routing rules in config server   
   `zuul.proxy.route.customers: /customers`
* Uses `Hystrix->Ribbon->Eureka` to forward requests to appropriate service

[source,groovy]
----
@EnableZuulProxy
@Controller
class Application {
}
----

== Spring Cloud Stream

* Messaging for microservices
* Just write business logic
* Choice of transport, Rabbit, Kafka, Redis (defaults based on classpath)

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@MessageEndpoint
public class Endpoint {
   @ServiceActivator(inputChannel=Sink.INPUT)
   public void handle(Foo payload) {
      // .. handle message
   }
}
----

== Spring Cloud Sleuth

* Tracing for microservices
* Transparent instrumentation for Spring apps
* Correlation IDs added to HTTP requests and messages
* Log support (ELK etc.)
* Zipkin

== Developer Experience

> As a microservice developer, I want to write code and run it
> locally, but have a high confidence that it will work in the target
> system.

* Stubbing and contract-driven development
* Remote debugging, e.g. Spring Boot live reload
* Register local app with remote service catalog
