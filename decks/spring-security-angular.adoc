== Outline

Imagine several physical implementations of the same system with an identical Javascript client (single page application) and a secure back end. Application and security architecture variations:

|===
| Application | Description | Security

| `basic`
| Single backend with local user login and backend service
| HTTP Basic for all authentications

| `single`
| Adds form authentication, but static HTML and an API resource still in the same server
| Session cookie for all authentications after login, optional use of Spring Session to distribute data and/or change cookie name

| `vanilla`
| Backend split between UI (with login) and services in separate JVM, client calls services directly. 
| Session cookie used for UI as cookie. Backend is unsecured.

| `spring-session`
| Adds secure backend with custom token.
| Form login and session cookie for UI, using session ID for backends as custom token. Spring Session ID is the token.

| `proxy`
| Client calls services through UI acting as proxy. UI (with login) and services in separate JVM.
| Session cookie used for all calls (proxy forwards cookie header), distributed via Spring Session

| `vanilla-oauth2`
| Add OAuth2 SSO with a separate authentication server
| Session cookie used for UI and access token for backends

| `oauth2`
| Use JWT for OAuth2 token and add form login to authorization server
| Show that sessions are still needed for CSRF protection
