== Outline

Imagine several physical implementations of the same system with an identical Javascript client (single page application) and a secure back end. Application and security architecture variations:

|===
| Application | Security

| Single backend with local user login and backend service Standard
| JSESSIONID cookie for all authentications after login, optional use of Spring Session to distribute data and/or change cookie name

| Backend split between UI (with login) and services in separate JVM, client calls services directly
| JSESSIONID used for UI as cookie and for backends as custom token

| Backend split between UI (with login) and services in separate JVM, client calls services through UI acting as proxy
| JSESSIONID cookie used for all calls (proxy forwards cookie header), distributed via Spring Session

| Add OAuth2 SSO with a separate authentication server
| JSESSIONID used for UI as cookie and access token for backends

| Use JWT for OAuth2 token 
| Show that sessions are still needed for CSRF protection
