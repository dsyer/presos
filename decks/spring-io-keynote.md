## Spring Boot Overview

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade
> applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an
> opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing
> users can quickly get to the bits they need.

## Spring Boot Goals

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience
* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to
  diverge from the defaults
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
  (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

Cool! Now what else can I do with it?  

<br/><br/>

1. How can I extend it?  
2. Can I use a traditional WAR deployment?
