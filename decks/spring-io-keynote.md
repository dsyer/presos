## Spring Boot Overview

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade
> applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an
> opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing
> users can quickly get to the bits they need.

## Spring Boot Goals

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience
* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to
  diverge from the defaults
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
  (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

## Spring Boot Modules

* Spring Boot - main library supporting the other parts of Spring Boot
* Spring Boot Autoconfigure - a single `@EnableAutoConfiguration`
  annotation triggers a Spring context
* Spring Boot Starters - a set of convenient dependency descriptors
  that you can include in your application.
* Spring Boot CLI - compiles and runs Groovy source as a Spring
  application
* Spring Boot Actuator - comman non-functional features that make an
  app instantly deployable and supportable in production
* Spring Boot Tools - for building and executing self-contained JAR
  and WAR archives
* Spring Boot Samples - a wide range of sample apps

## Spring 4.0

* New Baseline = JDK 6+, Servlet 3.0, and other 3rd pary OS libraries
* Latest of specs - JPA 2.1, Bean Valid 2.1, JMS 2.0, JSR-356, JSR-236
* Java 8: Lambda, method references
* WebSocket
* Messaging (and WebSocket support)
* Web improvements: async, HATEOAS, cache busting
