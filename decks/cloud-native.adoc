* What is it?
* Why do we need it?
* How do we do it?

== Does This Sound Good?

* Speed
* Safety
* Scale
* Mobility

== Microservice

> Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with bounded contexts...
-- @adrianco

If every service has to be updated in concert, it's not loosely coupled.

If you have to know about the internals of surrounding services you don't have a bounded context.

== Monoliths

* Modularity dependent on language / framework
* Change cycle tightly coupled -> obstacle to frequent deploys
* Inefficient scaling
* Intimidating to new developers (and for old ones)
* Obstacle to scaling feature development
* Requires long-term commitment to stack

> *Easy* but Complex

== Microservices

* Modularity based on component services
* change cycle decoupled -> frequent deploys
* Efficient scaling
* Individual components easy to understand
* Enables scaling development
* Eliminates long-term commitment to stack

> Simple but *Hard*

== Wait, It's Hard?

No such thing as a free lunch

* Operations overhead
* Devops skill shortage
* Interface / context governance
* Duplication of effort
* Distributed system complexity
* Asynchronous is difficult
* Testability challenges

== 12-Factor Application Patterns

- Optimized for speed, safety, & scale
- Declarative configuration
- Stateless/shared-nothing processes
- Single binary distribution per process
- Loose coupling to application environment

== Microframeworks

- Dropwizard (http://www.dropwizard.io/)
- Spring Boot (http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

== Spring Boot

- http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot
- Opinionated convention over configuration
- Production-ready Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow
- *STARTERS*
- Actuator: Metrics, health checks, introspection

== No Microservice is an Island

== Challenges of Distributed Systems

* Configuration Management
* Service Registration & Discovery
* Routing & Load Balancing
* Fault Tolerance (Circuit Breakers!)
* Monitoring and Tracing
* API Aggregation & Transformation

== Spring Cloud

- http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud
- Opinionated convention over configuration
- Common patterns, pre-shaved yaks
- Declarative distributed systems
- Embed Netflix OSS and other popular tools (Zipkin, Kafka, Rabbit, Zookeeper, Consul, Hazelcast, Cloud Foundry)

== Phew! Spring Saves the World

[.big]
Q: There's a technology solution to all those problems? +
 +
A: _TL;DR_ Probably not

== Process

- **Deliver** (Day One)
- **Continuously** (Day Two and Beyond)

== Some Practical Advice

_Paraphrasing @adrianco:_

[.big]
Get out of the business of infrastructure *and* +
automation (a.k.a. "undifferentiated heavy lifting")

{nbsp} +

- Internet giants, ratio of app to infra developers = 10:1
- Your business (= your apps) is special, your infrastructure is not
- Don't try to differentiate on something that is a commodity

== You're Going to Need a Platform

Platform features:

| **Infrastructure** | **Application**

| Environment Provisioning
| Distributed/Versioned Config

| On-Demand/Automatic Scaling
| Service Registration/Discovery

| Failover Resilience
| Routing/Load Balancing

| Routing/Load Balancing
| Service Integration

| Data Service Operations
| Fault Tolerance

| Monitoring
| Asynchronous Messaging
