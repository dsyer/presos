== Why Cloud Native?

* Speed
* Safety
* Scale
* Mobility

== What is Cloud Native?

> If you make the rule that you own the code that you write, you soon get to know what #cloudnative means!
-- @david_syer

* Twelve Factor Apps (http://12factor.net)
* Microservices
* Self-service, agile infrastructure
* Contract-based collaboration (APIs, messages)
* Antifragility

== Is There Maybe Some Hype?

== Microservice

> Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with bounded contexts...
-- @adrianco

If every service has to be updated in concert, it's not loosely coupled.

If you have to know about the internals of surrounding services you don't have a bounded context.

== Not Monoliths...

== Not Traditional (ESB-centric) SOA...

== But Microservices!

== Monoliths

* Complex / Easy
* Modularity dependent on launguage / framework
* Change cycle tightly coupled -> obstacle to frequent deploys
* Inefficient scaling
* Intimidating to new developers (and for old ones)
* Obstacle to scaling feature development
* Requires long-term commitment to stack

== Microservices

* Simple / Hard
* Modularity based on component services
* change cycle decoupled -> frequent deploys
* Efficient scaling
* Individual components easy to understand
* Enables scaling development
* Eliminates long-term commitment to stack

== Wait, It's Hard?

No such thing as a free lunch

* Operations overhead
* Devops skill shortage
* Interface / context governance
* Duplication of effort
* Distributed system complexity
* Asynchronous is difficult
* Testability challenges

== Enabling Continuous Delivery

- **Deliver** (Day One)
- **Continuously** (Day Two and Beyond)

== Cloud Native Objective

[NOTE]
====
Get out of the business of infrastructure *and* automation +
(a.k.a. "undifferentiated heavy lifting")
====

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

- Internet giants, ratio of app to infra developers = 10:1
- Your business (= your apps) is special, your infrastructure is not
- Don't try to differentiate on something that is a commodity

== 12-Factor Application Patterns

- Cloud-native application architectures
- Optimized for speed, safety, & scale
- Declarative configuration
- Stateless/shared-nothing processes
- Loose coupling to application environment

== Microframeworks

- Dropwizard (http://www.dropwizard.io/)
- Spring Boot (http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

== Spring Boot

- http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot
- Opinionated convention over configuration
- Production-ready Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow
- *STARTERS*
- Actuator: Metrics, health checks, introspection

== No Microservice is an Island

== Challenges of Distributed Systems

* Configuration Management
* Service Registration & Discovery
* Routing & Load Balancing
* Fault Tolerance (Circuit Breakers!)
* Monitoring and Tracing
* API Aggregation & Transformation

== Spring Cloud

- http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud
- Opinionated convention over configuration
- Common patterns, pre-shaved yaks
- Declarative distributed systems
- Embed Netflix OSS and other popular tools (Zipkin, Kafka, Rabbit, Zookeeper, Consul, Hazelcast, Cloud Foundry)
