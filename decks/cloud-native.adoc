== Why Cloud Native?

* Speed
* Safety
* Scale
* Mobility

== What is Cloud Native?

* Twelve Factor Apps (http://12factor.net)
* Microservices
* Self-service, agile infrastructure
* Contract-based collaboration (APIs, messages)
* Antifragility

== Is There Maybe Some Hype?

== Microservice

> Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with bounded contexts...
-- Adrian Cockcroft

If every service has to be updated in concert, it's not loosely coupled.

If you have to know about the internals of surrounding services you don't have a bounded context.

== Enabling Continuous Delivery

- **Deliver** (Day One)
- **Continuously** (Day Two and Beyond)

== Cloud Native is NOT:

* Configuring infrastructure
* Orchestrating containers
* Composing distributed systems
* Supporting ad-hoc general purpose automation

> ad hoc automation is a problem masquerading as a solution

== I Regret to Inform You, but...

* You're not that smart
* You're not different
* You're not special

== Cloud Native Objective

[NOTE]
====
Get out of the business of infrastructure *and* automation +
(a.k.a. "undifferentiated heavy lifting")
====

{nbsp} +

- Internet giants, ratio of app to infra developers = 10:1
- What is left that is special? Your business = your apps.


== 12-Factor Application Patterns

- Cloud-native application architectures
- Optimized for speed, safety, & scale
- Declarative configuration
- Stateless/shared-nothing processes
- Loose coupling to application environment

== Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
-- Melvyn Conway, 1967

== Platform Should Remind Us:

* We're not that smart
* We're not different
* We're not special

== Cloud Native Contracts
