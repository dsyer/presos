== Outline
* Define microservices
* Outline some distributed system problems
* Introduce Netflix OSS and its integration with Spring Boot
* Spring Cloud demos

== What are micro-services?
* Not monolithic :-)
* Smaller units of a larger system
* Runs in its own process
* Lightweight communication protocols
* Single Responsibility Principle
* The UNIX way

== Spring Boot

It needs to be super easy to implement and update a service:

[source,groovy]
----
@RestController
class ThisWillActuallyRun {
    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        Hello World!
    }
}
----

and you don't get much more "micro" than that.

== Cloud Foundry

Deploying services needs to be simple and reproducible

[source,console]
----
$ cf push app -p app.groovy
----

and you don't get much more convenient than that.

(Same argument for other PaaS solutions)

== Continuous Delivery

* Microservices lend themselves to continuous delivery.
* You actually *need* continuous delivery to extract maximum value.
* **New:** ALM support in Cloudfoundry from Cloudbees

== Example Distributed System: Minified

There are laws of physics that make some problems unsolvable
(consistency, latency), but brittleness and manageability can be
addressed with *generic*, *boiler plate* patterns.

== Emergent features of micro-services systems

Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns

* Distributed/versioned configuration
* Service registration and discovery
* Routing
* Service-to-service calls
* Load balancing
* Circuit Breaker
* Asynchronous patterns
* Distributed messaging

== Spring IO Platform

== Example: Coordination Boiler Plate

== Netflix OSS

* Eureka
* Hystrix & Turbine
* Ribbon
* Feign
* Zuul
* Archaius

* Curator
* Asgaard
* ...

== Example: Spring Cloud and Netflix

== Configuration Server
* Pluggable source
* Git implementation
* Versioned
* Rollback-able
* Configuration client auto-configured via starter

== Discovery: Eureka
* Service Registration Server
* Highly Available
* In AWS terms, multi Availability Zone and Region aware

== Circuit Breaker: Hystrix
* latency and fault tolerance
* isolates access to other services
* stops cascading failures
* enables resilience
* circuit breaker pattern
* dashboard

== Hystrix Observable

[source,java]
----
@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod="getDefaultMessage")
public String getMessage() {
  return restTemplate.getForObject(/*...*/);
}

public String getDefaultMessage() {
  return "Hello World Default";
}

// somewhere else
helloService.getMessage();
----

== Circuit Breaker Metrics

* Via actuator `/metrics`
* Server side event stream `/hystrix.stream`
* Dashboard app via `@EnableHystrixDashboard`
* Aggregation via Spring Cloud Turbine

== Routing: Zuul
* JVM based router and filter
* Similar routing role as httpd, nginx, or CF go router
* Fully programmable rules and filters
* Groovy
* Java
* Any JVM language

== How Netflix uses Zuul
* Authentication
* Insights
* Stress Testing
* Canary Testing
* Dynamic Routing
* Service Migration
* Load Shedding
* Security
* Static Response handling
* Active/Active traffic management

== Spring Cloud Zuul Proxy
* Store routing rules in config server   
   `zuul.proxy.route.customers: /customers`
* Uses `Hystrix->Ribbon->Eureka` to forward requests to appropriate service

[source,groovy]
----
@EnableZuulProxy
@Controller
class Application {
}
----

* Can be used as "sidecar" (or standalone edge server) via `@EnableSidecar`
