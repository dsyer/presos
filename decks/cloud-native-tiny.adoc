== Does This Sound Good?

* Speed
* Safety
* Scale
* Mobility

== Not Monoliths...

== But Microservices!

-- @adrianco

If every service has to be updated in concert, it's not loosely coupled.

If you have to know about the internals of surrounding services you don't have a bounded context.

== Process

- **Deliver** (Day One)
- **Continuously** (Day Two and Beyond)

== Some Practical Advice

_Paraphrasing @adrianco:_

[.big]
Get out of the business of infrastructure *and* +
automation (a.k.a. "undifferentiated heavy lifting")

{nbsp} +

- Internet giants, ratio of app to infra developers = 10:1
- Your business (= your apps) is special, your infrastructure is not
- Don't try to differentiate on something that is a commodity

== You're Going to Need a Platform

Platform features:
